🌟 Star Patterns in Array


Welcome to the Star Patterns in  repository!


This project is designed to help students and beginner programmers learn about creating star patterns using programming logic.
By exploring and experimenting with these patterns,
you'll strengthen your understanding of loops, and nested iterations.

📚 What You'll Learn

How to use nested loops to generate patterns.
Logical thinking to create visually appealing outputs.
Hands-on practice with programming concepts.

🛠️ Patterns Included.

This repository includes 19 star patterns,
ranging from simple to complex,
so you can learn progressively.
Each pattern is numbered for easy navigation:

🎯 Who Is This For?.
